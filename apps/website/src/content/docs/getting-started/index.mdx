# How to use emojis?

## Using Emojis in Dropdown Menus and Buttons

Our Discord bot allows you to create dropdown menus and buttons for role assignment. You can enhance these elements by adding custom or built-in emojis. Here's how you can use them:

### Built-in Emojis

For built-in emojis, you need to use the Unicode representation of the emoji. For example, instead of using `:sob:`, you should use the Unicode representation `ðŸ˜­`.

### Custom Emojis

For custom emojis, you need to use the format `<:name:id>`. This format includes the emoji's name and its unique ID. Here's a breakdown of the format:

- `name`: The name of the custom emoji.
- `id`: The unique ID of the custom emoji.

### Getting the Correct Format

To get the correct format for a custom emoji, follow these steps:

1. Type `\:emoji:` in a Discord chat and send the message.
2. Discord will display the emoji in the correct format, which looks like `<:name:id>`.
3. Copy the displayed format and paste it into the "emoji" text field in the modal.
